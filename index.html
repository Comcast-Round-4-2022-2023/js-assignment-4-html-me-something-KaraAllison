         <h2 id="mainHeading">Chapter 1: Acts of Proteus</h2>
         <p>Proteus was shadowed in a large air shaft near the ceiling of the Metropolis museum.
            Had he been dressed in white, the human eye would only barely recognize his form, but in his black garb it was strictly impossible to see him.
            Around the shaft were walls of the purest ivory upon which were extravagant carvings that depicted hundreds of stories and legends.
            Below that was a black and white marble floor, it was smooth as glass and shined in the dim candle lights that lit the massive room.
            Along the show floor were assorted displays of glass and oak that gave shelter to the most treasured artifacts of the days of old.
            Among the displays were five guards engaged in a systematic patrol, their steps appeared flawless.
            The guards wore dark reddish-brown leather armor.
            Tightly weaved leather protectted them from collar to waist, whilst thick sheets of overlapping leather covered shoulders and thighs.
            They wore dirty-white colored cloth underneath their armor and were armed with short swords.
            The swords were uncared for and starting to show small signs of rust; they were mere tools with scarce use.

            Shifting into a ready position, Proteus thought of how he had gotten to this point in his career.
            Throughout his life he had gone between masters, attaining mastery of numerous forms of the ninja arts.
            Eventually he had had made himself a deadly master of combat and attracted the attention of Chernobog.
            Once that happened it was fool hardy to deny Chernobog his services, the reason being that Chernobog wasn't the average employer; Chernobog was a god, and an evil one at that.
            Many great warriors had already fallen dead under the will of Chernobog for refusing the god, but Proteus was set on not adding to their numbers, regardless the cost.
            One could say Proteus was forced into the servitude of Chernobog,except that Proteus always seemed content in his way of life.
            This was so, because as wicked as Chernobog was, the god made sure that those who served his cause were rewarded handsomely.
            Proteus needed for nothing, and once this dark quest was complete he would want for nothing.
         </p>
         <p>
            Leaving his thoughts of the past behind him, Proteus scanned his surroundings and the placement of each of the five guards, taking every variable into careful consideration.
            There was no margin for error, even with his skill, if Proteus wasn't swift the guards could easily have him beaten by sheer numbers.
            Seeing an opportune moment Proteus leaped from his vantage point, his arms and legs remained outstretched in order achieve balance.
            Proteus' face was pale andd marred with a series of scars.
            He had a thoroughly masculine look about him, from his strong jaw to the rest of his body.
            His upper lip curled upward on one side as if in permanent distaste.
            Proteeus had green eyes and hair as black as night.
         </p>
         <p>
            He was dressed in a black, skin tight garb of cloth and leather.
            The cloth sleeves reached midway down his forearm and ended wide like two funnels.
            His shoulders and back were covered with a rippled segment of thick, protective leather.
            The same leather plated his thighs and shins.
            He wore black boots that were padded all around for stealth, yet comfortable durability.
            Crisscrossed in sheathes across his back were two identical katanas that were sharpened to the point of razon sharpness.
            Proteus wore a belt with numerous square pouches that contained various weapons of the ninja trade.
            This included throwing stars, herbs, chemical weapons, and other useful tools.
            Also on the belt was tied a velvet sack that seemed to be meant to contain an item of immense worth and importance.
         </p>
         <p>
            Proteus lunged his hand toward his belt and grabbed three throwing stars, one between each pair of fingers.
            <em>Zwoosh</em>, he sent them flying through the air with great speeed.
            The sharp spheres soared gracefully toward an unlucky gguard on the far side of the room.
            One sliced across his cheek, another pounded him in the chest, and the third cut clean through the jugular, the finishing blow.
            Blood streamed forth splattering across a nearby display case.
            Then Proteus contorted his body into an almost midair crouch, and he forced himself into a spiral while unsheathing both katanas from his back.
         </p>
         <p>
            Two guards suddenly turned toward Proteus, fear could easily be seen in their faces just before Proteus landed between them, slicing their chests open with his blades.
            Their fearful gasps persisted even in death as the collapsed face up o the floor.
            All had gone well so far, but the two remaining guards were now aware of his presence.
            They quickly drew their swords and approached the intruder.
            In reaction, holding one sword above his head and the other at his waist, Proteus prepared to receive a morre than likely rush from the guards.
            Both swords were parallel to the ground.
         </p>
         <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
            "On me, we can't let him leave alive!" shouted the first guard.<br>
            "Let's just kill him already, there's sure to be a bounty!" shouted the second.
         </p>

            The guards ran toward Proteus, weapons in hand, and not a single flinch came from Proteus' body or face.
            Then just as the two guards came within a foot of striking range Proteu broke his stillness and struck the men with swift retribution.
            The guard on his right, he stabbed through the throat, and he stuck the other right through the stomach.
            The deed was done.
            Proteus withdrew his swords and wipped the blood from them with his sleeve.
            He smoothly sheathed his weapons, then looked around for the prize he had killed so many to find.
            Just fourteen paces from where he stood lay the small trinket that would bring riches to him and damnation to the rest of the of the entire world.
